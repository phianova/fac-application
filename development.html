                <h3 class="career-header">Why I want to start a career in software development</h3>
                <p class="career-text">My background is in welfare policy and advice work. I had never considered a career in tech until the last 2 years, but my last role for a small policy consultancy and software company involved a lot of hands-on collaboration with a team of developers. 
                    <br>My role involved using my policy and legal knowledge to maintain the logic for a <a class="career-links" href="https://betteroffcalculator.co.uk">software product calculating welfare benefit entitlement</a> for low-income users. 
                    <br>An Excel-based record of this logic was the basis for integration tests for the policy engine underlying the software - meaning I would regularly be working with developers and engineers to debug the engine's Typescript code when integration tests failed or a logic issue was found. 
                    <br>I thoroughly enjoyed the problem-solving aspects of this work and found myself fascinated by the code and wanting to learn how to do more with it. 
                    <br>This role also involved performing data analysis in Stata (an R-based statistical programming language) and SQL, which again piqued my interest in the practical applications of code to what I was working on. 
                    <br>Basically, I was hooked.
                    <br><br>Since then I’ve been exploring as many self-paced study avenues as I can to begin to gain the technical skills I will need for a career in software development. 
                    <br>I’m keen to understand underlying ideas and principles in computer science too, so I've started working through the Harvard CS50 course. 
                    <br>I want to fully apply myself to something very different to my previous experiences, and exercise my problem-solving skills while developing a new skillset and understanding new technologies. 
                    <br><br>You can access my LinkedIn page below to see what I've done before - and I'll link here to badges and certifications as I earn them through my own learning.

                <h3 class="career-header">Building this site for my Founders and Coders application</h3>
                <p class="career-text">   
                    I started building this site having just completed the preparation work for the Founders & Coders course.
                    <br>I didn't really have any prior JavaScript experience, so this was a real hands-on learning experience for me.
                    <br>I started with the homepage, and wanted to use my newly-gained knowledge of CSS Flexbox to create the linked images below my intro text container.
                    <br>I learnt how to create fixed headers and footers, and later amended my header to make it a function navigation bar in pages other than the homepage.
                    <br>I know tiled baby seal cartoons aren't everyone's cup of tea but that background was one of the first things I learnt to do in CSS without referring directly back to the FreeCodeCamp course, so I've kept it in there as a kind of badge of honour.
                    <br>I knew I needed some unique features to showcase what I'd learnt. I think I saw someone else mentioning on the Founders & Coders Discord channel that they'd built their showcase pieces based on their own interests, and I thought that was a great idea.
                    <br>I had a few ideas around this and decided to start with a mood-based Spotify playlist, as I'm a music lover.
                    <br>This took a lot of experimentation and Googling and Stack-Overflow searching to work out, but I was really happy with the end product.
                    <br> TODO talk about other features when you've written them 
                    <br>All of the code for the website is contained within the linked repository below. The ReadME has further information on the development of both the website and game.

                <h3 class="career-header">Building Mudlark (the game) for my Founders and Coders application</h3>
                <p class="career-text">
                    Again, building the game was a real challenge for me. I had a clear idea of the story and what I wanted the game to look and feel like, but starting from scratch initially felt quite intimidating.
                    <br>I started by looking a couple of tutorials to get the gist of the standard elements needed to build a game.
                    <br>I initially followed some of <a class="career-links" href="https://www.codewizardshq.com/javascript-games/">this tutorial</a> to get an idea of how to set up a game environment using HTML Canvas.
                    <br>I also used <a class="career-links" href="https://www.w3schools.com/graphics/game_intro.asp">this guide</a> to help me understand the capabilities of the canvas and how to go about designing standard game elements.
                    <br>I later borrowed the idea of a "toggleScreen()" function from <a class="career-links" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FwLMz7jMRac">this video</a> which I found really helpful as I wanted my game to have a clear story.
                    <br>As I went along, I decided between different ways of implementing game elements that I had seen, and refined my code to reflect my game's actual needs.
                    <br>The first thing I did was code the movement of the player and the dog, and determine what happened when they collided.
                    <br>I then focused on my hidden items, and worked out how to randomly assign both their position and their type.
                    <br>I then created my starting screens, and used the same method to implement the screens that display when the items are found.
                    <br>Then, I created the scoring system and determined the conditions to win the game and what happened when that was achieved.
                    <br>I decided the game needed a tiny bit more of a challenging/competitive element so I added a timer.
                    <br>If I had had more time, I would have added further levels to the game, with additional dogs to make it more difficult.
                    <br>I also had planned to try and include a second area which the player could access via the leftmost border of the screen to make it harder to find the hidden items.
                    <br>The "tide coming in" screen that displays once the game has ended was also in my initial plan! I wanted to have that happen during the game, cutting off some of the game area to make it more difficult to find the items.
                    <br>I may make these changes in a separate branch while the application is in progress, just for fun! But thought it was better to ensure I had something workable to submit by the deadline.
                    <br>All of the code for the game is contained in the linked repository below. The JS code is in the file entitled mudlark.js. The ReadME has further information on the development of both the website and game.
