Hi! This is the code for my portfolio website.
This website was created to support my application to the Founders and Coders programme, but will hopefully also serve as a useful general portfolio of my future work!

SITEMAP:
1. Homepage - where you'll land.
2. About me - a bit about me and my interests plus a couple of small JS features I used to practice. Features include:
    a. Randomised video link
    b. Mood-based Spotify playlist selector
    c. Short dice-rolling "RPG"
    d. Travel photo gallery with map links
3. Development - a bit about my aspirations and what I hope to achieve with this move in my career, as well as detail on how I found building the site and the game.
4. Links - where to find me on the rest of the web!
5. Mudlark - a short game I built, also to support my Founders and Coders application.
