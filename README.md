Hi! This is the code for my portfolio website.
This website was created to support my application to the Founders and Coders programme, but will hopefully also serve as a useful general portfolio of my future work!

SITEMAP:
> Homepage - where you'll land.
    > About me - a bit about me and my interests plus a couple of small JS features I used to practice.
        > Music 
            > Randomised link //UNDER CONSTRUCTION
            > Spotify playlist selector
        > Nature //UNDER CONSTRUCTION
        > DND //UNDER CONSTRUCTION
    > Why this? Why now? - a bit about my aspirations and what I hope to achieve with this move in my career
    > Links - where to find me on the rest of the web!
    > Mudlark - a short game I built, also to support with my Founders and Coders application.
