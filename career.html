                <h3>Why development?</h3>
                <p>My background is in welfare policy and advice work. I had never considered a career in tech before, but my last role for a small policy consultancy and software company involved interacting with and working with a lot of developers, sometimes in a very hands-on way. 
                    <br>My role involved using my policy and legal knowledge to maintain an Excel-based representation of the logic for a tool calculating benefit entitlement for low-income users. 
                    <br>This was the basis for integration tests for the software powering the tool - meaning I would regularly be working with developers and engineers to debug the Typescript code when integration tests failed or a logic issue was found. 
                    <br>I thoroughly enjoyed the problem-solving aspects of this work and found myself fascinated by the code and wanting to learn how to do more with it. 
                    <br>This role also involved performing data analysis in Stata (an R-based statistical programming language) which again piqued my interest in the practical applications of code to what I was working on. 
                    <br>Basically, I was hooked.
                    <br><br>Since then I’ve been exploring as many self-paced study avenues as I can to get to grips with the technical skills I might need for a development career. 
                    <br>I’m keen to understand underlying ideas and principles in computer science too, so I’m working through the Harvard CS50 course. 
                    <br>I want to apply myself to something different to my previous experiences and exercise my problem-solving skills while learning new things.
